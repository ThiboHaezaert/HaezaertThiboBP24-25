  abstract  = {Library OSes are a promising approach for applications to efficiently obtain the benefits of virtual machines, including security isolation, host platform compatibility, and migration. Library OSes refactor a traditional OS kernel into an application library, avoiding overheads incurred by duplicate functionality. When compared to running a single application on an OS kernel in a VM, recent library OSes reduce the memory footprint by an order-of-magnitude.Previous library OS (libOS) research has focused on single-process applications, yet many Unix applications, such as network servers and shell scripts, span multiple processes. Key design challenges for a multi-process libOS include management of shared state and minimal expansion of the security isolation boundary.This paper presents Graphene, a library OS that seamlessly and efficiently executes both single and multi-process applications, generally with low memory and performance overheads. Graphene broadens the libOS paradigm to support secure, multi-process APIs, such as copy-on-write fork, signals, and System V IPC. Multiple libOS instances coordinate over pipe-like byte streams to implement a consistent, distributed POSIX abstraction. These coordination streams provide a simple vantage point to enforce security isolation.},

  abstract = {Trust management is fundamental to identify malicious, selfish, and compromised nodes which have been authenticated. Many trust management mechanisms are proposed to provide effective security solution for wire and wireless networks, even some of them have become one of the most known in this field. But in fact, trust management in wireless sensor networks still remains a challenging field. Traditional trust models developed for wireless sensor networks are not well suited for sensor networks because the trust evaluation process isn’t related to certain application. In this paper, we propose a self-adaptive trust management scheme, which can adaptively adjust the trust evaluation process to cope with application requirement changes of trust management. The simulation results show that our scheme has less rate of inauthentic downloads of nodes, energy consumption and message overheads as compared to the current state-of-the-art trust management schemes, and it is more suitable for large-scale sensor networks.},

  abstract = {This paper focuses on the security protocols enacted in banking transactions across the European Economic Area (EEA), as stipulated by the Second or Revised Payment Service Directive (commonly referred to as `PSD2' or simply `the Directive'). The study aims to comprehensively analyse the implementation and efficacy of these security measures within the specified jurisdiction. The Directive incorporates fundamental rights and obligations that all stakeholders are compelled to adhere to and delineates specific security measures and standards that both traditional banking institutions and third-party providers (TPP) are mandated to implement. In particular, one of the cardinal mandates for banking and financial institutions under PSD2 is the obligation to facilitate third-party access to customer data via open application programming interfaces (API). While this open banking paradigm and the consequent proliferation of data sharing unquestionably bring about various advantages, such as enhanced consumer choice and market competition, they concurrently expose the financial ecosystem to a slew of potential security vulnerabilities and privacy risks. Upon conducting a comprehensive review of the security requirements and measures stipulated under PSD2 and a comparative analysis with essential cybersecurity frameworks and standards (NIS2, Cybersecurity Act, GDPR, ISO 27001:22 and PCI DSS), we have ascertained a discernible lack of harmonisation and clarity concerning the technical security specifications for its effective implementation. This lacuna substantiates the challenges banks face in fully grasping the extensive spectrum of compliance obligations mandated by PSD2. The aim of this research is to offer a valuable contribution to both the comprehension and the pragmatic deployment of security standards in the context of banking transactions, as regulated by the PSD2. The paper serves as a valuable resource for traditional banking institutions and relevant stakeholders by guiding them through the complexities of PSD2 implementation while also evaluating the effects of the security measures on transactional safeguards, data security, and the provision of payment services.},
